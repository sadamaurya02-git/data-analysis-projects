**Yulu: Hypothesis Testing**

**About:**
Yulu is India’s leading micro-mobility platform offering eco-friendly shared electric cycles for daily commutes. The company aims to identify key factors influencing ride demand to optimize fleet management and boost revenue.

**Objective:**
Use hypothesis testing to determine which factors (season, weather, day type, temperature, etc.) significantly impact demand for Yulu bikes.

**Key Insights:**

- **Season & Weather:** Fall and clear weather show the highest ride volumes; spring and rainy days reduce demand.

- **Working Days:** No major difference in usage between working and non-working days — demand is fairly consistent.

- **Demand Optimization:**

  - Allocate more bikes during peak seasons and pleasant weather.

  - Use targeted promotions and discounts during off-peak or bad-weather days.

  - Focus weekday supply near office zones and weekend supply near parks or tourist spots.

  - Forecasting: Build predictive models using features like season, temperature, humidity, and weather to optimize fleet planning.
